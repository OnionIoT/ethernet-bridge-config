# Omega2 Ethernet Bridge Configuration Files

Config files to set up your Omega2 as an Ethernet bridge. Copy `etc/config/network` to the same path in your Omega - replacing `network` - to get it working. You'll need an Ethernet Expansion and a cable. Run  `/etc/init.d/network restart` for it to take effect.
